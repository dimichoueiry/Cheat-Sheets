## üìö Core Concepts Table

| **Concept Name** | **Example Usage / Description** | **Short Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Scrum Roles | Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team | Defines clear responsibilities within the team. |
| Scrum Artifacts | Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Increment | Provides transparency and tracking of work. |
| Sprint | 1-4 week time-boxed iteration | Core unit of work in SCRUM, delivering a usable product increment. |
| Product Backlog | List of all desired work features | Maintained by Product Owner; evolves continuously. |
| Sprint Backlog | Selected Product Backlog items for a sprint | Work plan for the sprint, managed by the development team. |
| Increment | Sum of all completed work during a sprint | Delivered product functionality after each sprint. |
| Daily Scrum | 15-minute daily meeting | Keeps team aligned; each member answers: What did I do yesterday? What will I do today? Any blockers? |
| Sprint Planning | Meeting at the start of a sprint | Team plans what can be delivered and how work will be achieved. |
| Sprint Review | Meeting at the end of a sprint | Showcase the increment, get feedback from stakeholders. |
| Sprint Retrospective | Post-sprint meeting | Reflect on what went well, what didn't, and how to improve. |
| Definition of Done (DoD) | "Ready for production", "Code reviewed", "Test cases passed" | Agreed criteria that a backlog item must meet to be considered complete. |
| Velocity | Story points completed per sprint | Helps estimate future sprints. |
| Burndown Chart | Visual chart showing remaining work in a sprint | Tracks progress visually, aiming to reach zero by sprint end. |

## üî• Common Operations & Usage Scenarios

| **Operation/Task** | **Usage & Practical Example** |
| --- | --- |
| **Creating Product Backlog** | Write clear, prioritized user stories with acceptance criteria. |
| **Estimating Tasks** | Use Planning Poker or T-shirt sizing to assign story points (ex: 3 points = medium complexity). |
| **Sprint Planning Execution** | Product Owner presents top-priority items, team selects achievable ones for Sprint Backlog. |
| **Running a Daily Standup** | Each team member answers: "What did I do yesterday? What will I do today? Any blockers?" |
| **Sprint Review Execution** | Demo the Increment to stakeholders, gather feedback to adjust Product Backlog. |
| **Conducting Retrospective** | Use Start-Stop-Continue method to improve team processes. |
| **Tracking Progress with Burndown Chart** | Update remaining story points daily to visualize sprint completion. |
| **Adjusting Sprint Backlog (if needed)** | If priority shifts mid-sprint, team re-discusses scope adjustments transparently. |

## üí° Useful Tips / Pro Tips / Best Practices

1. **Keep Backlog Grooming Regular:** Don‚Äôt leave backlog refinement for Sprint Planning only. Continuously groom to reduce meeting fatigue.
2. **Definition of Done Clarity:** Ensure DoD is clear, non-negotiable, and agreed upon. Prevents ambiguity on what‚Äôs "done."
3. **Don‚Äôt Overcommit:** Track historical velocity to avoid overloading a sprint.
4. **Daily Standups = Not Status Meetings:** Focus on collaboration, blockers, not reporting to a manager.
5. **Retrospective Action Items:** Assign concrete owners & deadlines to retro-improvement points.
6. **Time-box All Meetings:** Prevent endless discussions; set clear start and end times.
7. **Visualize Workflow:** Use Kanban boards or digital tools (Jira, Trello) for better transparency.
8. **Encourage Cross-Functional Skills:** Avoid bottlenecks; promote T-shaped skills within the team.
